## Bring The Number Back!

The game is yet another implementation of the good old Bulls'&'Cows. The challenge though is that it's an entry for the 2019 Js13kGames coding competition and hence has to be under  13 kb.
  
### Gameplay
  
You and Robot make a four-digit number with no digit duplication. Then you both score the opponent's guess and try to guess the opponent's number in turns.

The score here is a two-digit number with the first digit representing a total of guessed digits and the second one representing a number of the guessed digits in the right positions.

The applied algorithm is proven to get your number in seven steps or less. So, good luck!
