  # Arithmetic Hunt
  The game is an entry for the 2018 Js13kGames coding competition.
  
  ### Rules
  
- Move your circle by mouse in order to hit the right expressions and to avoid the incorrect ones.
- Think fast! You have 15 seconds to find next correct expression.
- Small balls are neither dangerous nor count as correct ones.
- As the games goes, the expressions become a bit more complicated and their number increases.
- To show / hide help (while the game is over) use ```ESC```
- To start / restart the game hit ```SPACE```.

**Good luck!**
